# Project Overview

## Project Name
A simple console application in C# that processes user input and performs date calculations.

## Purpose
The program is designed to:
1. Process and display any arguments passed to it.
2. Validate a date entered by the user in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. Calculate the number of days in the month of the entered date.

## Main Features

### 1. **`Main` Method**
- The entry point of the application.
- Performs the following tasks:
  - Calls the `ProcessArguments` method to process any passed arguments.
  - Reads a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` from the console.
  - Validates the entered date.
  - Calculates the number of days in the month of the entered date using the `Copilot_C_.DateCalculations.DaysInMonth` method.

### 2. **`ProcessArguments` Method**
- Processes the arguments passed to the program.
- Returns a message indicating whether arguments were passed or not.
- Return values:
  - `"No arguments were passed"`: If no arguments were provided.
  - `"Arguments passed were: <arguments>"`: If arguments were provided.

### 3. **Date Validation**
- Checks if the entered date:
  - Is not empty.
  - Is exactly 10 characters long.
  - Contains the `'-'` character.
- Displays an error message if the date is invalid.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Uses a `try-catch` block to avoid errors when parsing the date.
- Displays an error message if the date cannot be parsed correctly.

## Dependencies
- **Namespace:** `Copilot_C_`
  - Contains the `DateCalculations.DaysInMonth` method, which calculates the number of days in a given month.

## Requirements
- **C# Version:** 12.0
- **.NET Target Version:** .NET 8

## Example Output
### Input:
2025-02-29

### Output:
Days in Month: 28

## Possible Improvements
- **Error Handling:** The error message in the `catch` block could be made more specific.
- **Code Structure:** Methods like date validation could be extracted to improve readability.
- **User Experience:** Additional input guidance could be provided to the user.
