# Pricing of LLMs (Large Language Model)

## Token usage

-token usage and charges can vary depending on the LLM in use. 
Here are some general points to consider:

1. Model Size and Complexity: Larger models (e.g., GPT-4) typically consume more tokens per request and are more expensive compared to smaller models (e.g., Phi-4-mini).
2. Token Pricing: Each provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI Service) has its own pricing structure for tokens. 

### For example

OpenAI charges differently for input tokens (tokens sent in the prompt) and output tokens (tokens generated by the model).
Azure OpenAI Service may have region-specific pricing.

Context Length: Models with larger context windows (e.g., GPT-4-32k) allow for more tokens in a single request but may incur higher costs.
Thought that this kind of. I. 
Provider-Specific Costs: If you're using a service like Azure OpenAI, the pricing might differ slightly from OpenAI's direct pricing.

### Managing costs effectively

- Use smaller models for less complex tasks.
- Optimize prompts to reduce token usage.
- Monitor usage through the provider's dashboard.

### The best model depends on your use case:

For balance between cost and performance, try GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
For fast, low-cost support for basic tasks, try o3-mini or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
For deep reasoning or complex coding challenges, try o1, GPT-4.5, or Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
For multimodal inputs and real-time performance, try Gemini 2.0 Flash or GPT-4o.

### Premium Features

Different models have different premium request multipliers, which can affect how much of your monthly usage allowance is consumed. 
Some Copilot features use more advanced processing power and count as premium requests. The number of premium requests a feature consumes can vary depending on the feature and the AI model used.

*** Premium features
The following Copilot features can use premium requests:

- Copilot Chat
- Copilot agent mode
- Copilot code review
- Copilot Extensions

### Example of premium request usage

If you use GPT-4.5 (50Ã— multiplier) to ask a single question in Copilot Chat, that interaction counts as 50 premium requests.
If you're on Copilot Free, even interactions with the base model use 1 premium request each.
If you're on a paid plan, using the base model does not count against your monthly premium request allowance.
If you've enabled additional usage, premium requests beyond your included monthly amount will be billed at $0.04 USD each.
Thank you.
